# Spring Boot 3.5 Template Service Plan

## Research Summary (5/15 iterations used)

**Confidence**: HIGH - Current codebase provides solid foundation with Spring Boot 3.5.3, JWT authentication, and rate limiting
**Key Findings**: Project uses Spring Boot 3.5.3 with Java 24, has JWT authentication, role-based access control, rate limiting with Bucket4j, but lacks virtual threads implementation and microservices components

- **Dependencies**: Spring Boot 3.5.3, Spring Security, JWT (jjwt 0.12.6), Bucket4j 8.10.1, H2 Database, Lombok
- **Architecture**: MVC pattern with JWT authentication, custom role annotations (@IAdminRole, @IUserRole), rate limiting interceptor
- **Tech Stack**: Java 24, Spring Boot 3.5.3, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Maven
- **Patterns**: Configuration beans from `src/main/java/com/example/accesscontrol/config/`, Service layer from `src/main/java/com/example/accesscontrol/service/`, Repository pattern from `src/main/java/com/example/accesscontrol/repository/`

**Questions Asked** [3/3 REQUIRED]:
1. "Should I focus on extending the existing structure or create a completely new template?" â†’ "Extend existing structure to maintain backward compatibility"
2. "What specific microservices components are most important - service discovery, API gateway, distributed tracing?" â†’ "Focus on observability, resilience patterns, and cloud-native features"
3. "Are there specific performance requirements or virtual thread usage patterns you prefer?" â†’ "Prioritize virtual threads for I/O operations and async processing"
