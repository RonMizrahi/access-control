# Spring Boot 3.5 Template Docker & Local DevOps Plan

## Research Summary (3/10 iterations used)

**Confidence**: HIGH - Current Spring Boot 3.5.3 template with comprehensive observability features, Redis, Kafka, and Zipkin tracing configured
**Key Findings**: Application uses H2 in-memory database, Redis caching, Kafka messaging, and Zipkin tracing. Current configuration supports both minimal setup and full development environment with external services.

- **Dependencies**: Docker, Docker Compose, Maven, Java 24, Spring Boot 3.5.3, Redis, Kafka, Zipkin
- **Architecture**: Spring Boot application with optional Redis/Kafka/Zipkin services for local development
- **Tech Stack**: Java 24, Spring Boot 3.5.3, Maven, Docker, redis:7-alpine, confluentinc/cp-kafka, openzipkin/zipkin
- **Patterns**: Multi-stage Docker build for app, optional services in docker-compose, environment-based configuration

**Questions Asked** [3/3 REQUIRED]:

1. "I see the template uses H2, Redis, Kafka, and Zipkin. Should I include all external services in docker-compose for full local development, or keep it minimal with just the app?" â†’ "Include all services but make them optional with profiles - developers can choose minimal (H2 only) or full stack"
2. "For the Dockerfile, should I optimize for development (faster builds) or production (smaller image size)?" â†’ "Use multi-stage build that supports both - dev stage for faster iteration, production stage for deployment"
3. "Should Docker Compose include database alternatives like PostgreSQL for production-like testing?" â†’ "Yes, add PostgreSQL as an alternative to H2 with environment switching"

**Success Criteria**
- [x] App builds and runs in Docker container
- [x] Port 8080 accessible from host
- [x] Image runs as non-root user
- [x] Health endpoint responds correctly

**Testing**
- [x] Build image: `docker build -t spring-template .`
- [x] Run container: `docker run -p 8080:8080 spring-template`
- [x] Test health: `curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health`

**Implementation Notes**
- Use Eclipse Temurin for better performance with virtual threads
- Multi-stage build reduces final image size
- Include HEALTHCHECK instruction for container orchestration

## MVP Implementation Path Status: âšª **NOT STARTED**

### Unit 2: Docker Compose [Complete local development stack] Status: âšª **NOT STARTED**

**Complexity**: SMALL (3 points)
**Purpose**: Provide complete local development environment with all dependencies

**Changes**
- [ ] Add docker-compose.yml with app + Redis + Kafka + Zipkin + PostgreSQL
- [ ] Create docker-compose.override.yml for development-specific settings
- [ ] Add .env file for environment variables
- [ ] Create profiles for minimal (H2 only) vs full stack

- [ ] Zipkin UI accessible at http://localhost:9411
- [ ] Redis accessible on localhost:6379
- [ ] Kafka accessible on localhost:9092
- [ ] PostgreSQL accessible on localhost:5432

**Testing**
- [ ] Start minimal stack: `docker compose --profile minimal up`
- [ ] Start full stack: `docker compose --profile full up`
- [ ] Verify app health endpoint shows all service connections
- [ ] Test Redis caching and Kafka messaging
- [ ] Confirm traces appear in Zipkin UI

**Implementation Notes**
- Use official images: redis:7-alpine, postgres:16-alpine, confluentinc/cp-kafka:latest, openzipkin/zipkin
- Configure spring profiles to switch between H2 and PostgreSQL
- Add wait strategies for service dependencies
- Include volume mounts for data persistence in development

## Enhancement Implementation Path Status: âšª **NOT STARTED**

### Unit 3: Development Optimization [Hot reload and debugging] Status: âšª **NOT STARTED**

**Tags**:
- [DEMOABLE] - Live code changes without container rebuild

**Complexity**: SMALL (2 points)
**Purpose**: Optimize Docker setup for faster development iteration

**Changes**
- [ ] Add development Dockerfile with volume mounts for source code
- [ ] Enable spring-boot-devtools for hot reload
- [ ] Configure remote debugging on port 5005
- [ ] Add development docker-compose.override.yml
- [ ] Create scripts for common development tasks

**Success Criteria**
- [ ] Code changes reflected without full rebuild (where possible)
- [ ] IDE debugger can attach to running container
- [ ] Development restart time under 10 seconds
- [ ] Source code changes trigger automatic reload

**Testing**
- [ ] Modify Java file and verify hot reload
- [ ] Attach IDE debugger and hit breakpoint
- [ ] Measure restart time after code changes

**Implementation Notes**
- Use bind mounts for target/classes directory
- Configure JVM debug options: `-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005`
- Enable devtools restart with `spring.devtools.restart.enabled=true`
- Consider Spring Boot's layered JAR approach for faster rebuilds

- **Kafka management**: Add Kafka UI or Conduktor for message queue monitoring
- **Load testing**: Include JMeter or Artillery setup for performance testing

## Security & Compliance
- **Secrets management**: Integrate with HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
- **Security scanning**: Add OWASP dependency check and code security analysis
- **Image signing**: Implement container image signing with Cosign
- **SBOM generation**: Add Software Bill of Materials for supply chain security

## Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Kubernetes manifests**: Add Helm charts or Kustomize configurations
- **Terraform modules**: Infrastructure as Code for cloud deployment
- **Blue-green deployment**: Scripts for zero-downtime deployments
- **Backup strategies**: Database backup and restore procedures

## Developer Experience
- **VS Code devcontainer**: Complete development environment setup
- **Make/Gradle shortcuts**: Common task automation scripts
